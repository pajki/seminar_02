## Description

As stated in the seminar instructions, the excercise is structured into implementation and input folder. Input folder holds all the neccessary data to run the implemented methods. Implementation folder is divided into three separate parts - one for each implemented method. 

Methods regex and xpath contain a separate class for each pair of websites and those should be run to generate required json files. RoadRunner method is implemented in a single file, with the main function at the bottom, there are three block of code prepared to execute the algorithm for each pair of given websites.

Results folder is also present and it contains already extracted data with the implemented methods, along with the report, readme and .gitignore files all of which serve a pretty self explanatory function.
